This is an attempt to bring back to life the Kodi addon for WatchCartoonOnline, originally made by spoyser.
With the original project being GPL2, I suppose I can make a couple of modifications to the code and publish it.
Spoyser, if you want me to take this repository down, just mail me.

I'm only doing this for educational purposes (learning addon development for Kodi) and hold no responsibility 
for anyone who decides to use it for whatever purpose.
